# Self-care in the age of Don't care (by Owen Evans)
(or How to Self-care?)

* Define thyself (describe yourself in one line)
* You are more than what you do
* Self is not about what you do when you check dictionary
* Do you know yourself? (We know what tech skills we have. But we may not really know what drive us, causing cannot look after ourselves)

## Why should we care?
* old school management is dying
  * Technology industry is young 
  * people leave jobs after 3 to 4 years
* It is about motivation
  * how to motivate people to do the job? (Align your motivation to company motivation)
  * traditional management treat people like machines
  * intrinsic motivation is also a stronger predictor of job performance than extrinsic motivation
* Good motivator = desire to do the job
* Don’t need permission for self-care

-----

* Self care = self motivation to contribute to the company

* Self care is about introspective and self aware, to do anything you like

## Self-care:
* Take the time to do self-care
* Focus on values, not skills
* Assume good intentions (because even it wasn’t, it doesn’t matter because you didn’t own the whole experience)
* Biologically, no different between anxiety and excitement. The only difference is how you treat the situation (how you interpret)

## Find a coach
* coach is slightly different from mentor. Helping you by asking the right probing questions for you to think about
* Not necessary better than you


## Speaker’s Story:
* have to fire people (hard to do; worst things to do as a manager)
* Deeply cut out for a period
* Uncomfortable to fire the person who has hired and now is his friend.
* Seek help from coach, to get asked why the decision was make. This help the speaker to get through the difficult period

## Be your best self
- all you can control is who you are
- Take self care seriously
- Be excellent to each other
