# Inclusive Collaboration (by Aaron Hodder)

* Social anxiety disorder:
  * persistent fear of social situation
  * Or, “not have enough change for the bus fare”
  * Or, “prefer somewhere with familiar rules and can blend in”

* Agile = individual over process and tool
  * But in reality, agile = process and tool

* Employees need support in order to thrive.

## Social model of disability:

* Impairment + environment = disability 
* Eg. Some people get easily distracted by food and hunger.
  * Solution: lunch break, afternoon tea, Water readily available

-----

## Neuro-diversity and Tech
* high concentration of austism type

* We easily judge people not participate activities as “not a team player”, without considering their preference / neuro-diversity

### Individuals and Interactions:
* everyone behaves differently and have different working style. Eg. Some don’t like getting interrupted when in work. Some prefer having conversations when working
* Using headphones on or headphone on to indicate if a person is ok for distraction from work for discussion

* Know the person’s style:
  * Help in communication
  * Don’t feel offended when someone act in certain ways

* Environment and Support:
  * incubation = requires change environment; requires space. Eg. Taking shower in morning.
    * Solution: different area for different purposes: have separate quiet and loud places
  * Let people work on their specialisation or on their passion.

* Give benefit of doubt. Avoid jump to conclusion. Always ask “are you ok?” first.

* For A-social person, even if the person said “no” when asked for the drinks outside, doesn’t mean cannot be asked again in the future

## Wrap up

* Thinking outside of box requires diversity thinking
* Diversity thinking requires diversity mind
