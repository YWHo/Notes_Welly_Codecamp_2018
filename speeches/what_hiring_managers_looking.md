# What hiring managers are looking for?  (by Rachel Collingridge)
(Or Tales from recruitment land)

## Intro:
* musician
* Software Developer (by accident), for 18 years including dot net and visual basic. Now Ruby on Rails
* Manager & coach for (mostly) developers
* Recruiter of developers

## Why this talks?
* hiring and being hired is inescapable 
* People are important == recruitment is important 
* 50 CVs per month 
* Let’s be great at writing CVs

## What to expect: the process
* submit CV
* Interview 
* Technical Test

## What to expect: your treatment 
* An idea of what steps are involved
* Timely responses
  * Hiring managers have their day jobs apart from looking at CVs
* Fair treatment
* Feedback
  * Fair to ask feedback if the process stop at some point

## CV and cover letter
* Both please
* CV, no need other irrelevant information such as gender, age and photo. Good to put down visa status
* CV, max 2 pages
* 1 sheet of A4 in pdf format
* Up-to-date and proofread
* Cover letter: tailored to role (company, technology, location), and address it to hiring manager.
* In Cover Letter, mention why you want the job and what you can offer

## Technical testing
* There should be some!
* Write some code to solve a problem and discuss
* What we’re looking for (expect to behave like pair programming):
  * Expression of your thinking process in code (not just what you’re doing but how you are doing)
  * Familiarity with a language and software concepts
  * Curiosity
  * Explain yourself
  * Someone who can listen to feedback

## Interview:
* What we are looking for:
  * collaboration, team fit, team add
  * enthusiasm, growth mindset
  * self-awareness (aware of conflicts; having EQ to help out to resolve conflicts)
  * “I don’t know” (It is fine to say I don’t know during the interview, and then say ‘but I would google it’; or I will ask someone about it)
* Tips:
  * Be prepared!
  * Practice
  * Interviewers get nervous too

## What next?
* You got the job!
  * congratulations!
* You didn’t got the job!
  * ask for feedback
  * what did you learn? Reflect! (What did you do better? What you could do better?)
  * Try again in other companies (or try again after 6 months)

## Q&A:
* Mid-career change, how to get into the industry?
  * enthusiasm and growth mindset

* Pitfalls in technical test:
  * didn’t follow the instructions in online test (your behaviour is tracked)
  * Anxious to impress with coding skill (should stop, think about problem first)
  * The test is not about performance but how to arrive at solutions

* Core Skills from another industry is also important

* Bias affecting hiring?
  * Name may create bias, if weird pronunciation (solution: shorter similar name easy to pronounce)
  * No need photo in CV

* Conflict with colleague?
  * Sometimes the person was just suffering in health issues causing someone seems behaving badly. Eg. Toothache
