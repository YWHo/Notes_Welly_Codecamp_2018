# Mitigating Kernel Panic in non silicone workers (by Ellie Coyle)

* Burnt out = mental and physical effect of prolonged stress
* Stress = flight or fight
* Acute Stress = short term stress
* Chronic stress = long term stress
* Stress = drain away energy/resources from your body

* Maslach Burnout Inventory

-----

* Burnout:
  * exhaustion
  *  Cynicism
  * Inefficacy = reduced productivity/ unable to think to solve issue
* Burnt out = not just because work too long
* Burnt out when one or more areas of our work don’t match out needs:
  * workload
  * Control = autonomy 
  * Reward 
  * Community = network of support 
  * Fairness = tie to reward
  * Values = eg. Have time with family

## Spotting burnout:
* dreading work on Sunday
* Feeling exhaustion
*   If still feel tire after weekend rest, talk to doctor
* Less or no motivation
  * Red flag is asking ‘why am doing this?”
* Lack of concentration
* Self destructiveness

## Things to do to help:
* be healthy (don’t stress on feeling not healthy or on the missed yoga lesson)
* Holiday (book something in advance to create something to look forward; turn off anything related to work during holidays)
* Regular break during the day (temporary detachment from work desk can give fresh mindset)
* Ask for assistance (just got to ask, beware of imposter syndrome that stop you from getting help; use rubber ducky techniques to talk to it out; rubber ducky is not just used coding)
* Realism and positivity 
* Take control 
* Time management (including do nothing at spare time; time you enjoying wasting, is not a wasted time)
* Regular catharsis (release yourself through exercise or meditation)

## Wrap up
* Take time out of your day for yourself; even if just 5 mins
* do something you enjoying doing
